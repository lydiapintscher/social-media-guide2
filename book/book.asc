== Overview


== What Is Out There?

There are many social media websites. For now it should be enough to concentrate on the largest in each of those categories:

* news sites (digg, reddit)
* social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn, Xing, OpenDesktop.org)
* microblogging (identi.ca, Twitter)
* media sites (YouTube, Flickr)
* bookmarking sites (del.icio.us, StumbleUpon)
* others (Google Alerts)

There are more, but unless you have a huge team you will not be able to cover them all. Concentrate on the most important ones and let your wider community take care of the rest. However, don't automatically conclude that smaller sites are unimportant; sometimes the largest site in a category (Twitter) is not what the majority of Free Software developers use (Identi.ca).
